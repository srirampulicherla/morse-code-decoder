# Morse Code Decoder ðŸ”¦

This is a basic Morse Code Decoder project I built as part of my learning journey.

Even though the idea and logic are my own, I developed this using AI.

# Features
- Converts Morse code to readable text
- Simple and lightweight implementation
- Great for learning and experimenting with encoding/decoding

**Note**: This project was built for educational and demonstration purposes.
